When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When working with other people. When I want to share my work with someone else :)


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?


Because you can be working locally making changes you don't want in github and if you are working this will fuck your work.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Fork when you don't have permision to edit someone else's repository and want to mantain a copy of that repository on github.
Cloning when you want to make some changes but you don't want to modify the repository (locally or remote).
And branching when you are trying new features f.ex. and don't want to affect your production files.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

The benefit resides on that as long as it is a shared project you can always revert to this state if someone mess things up.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

Harder, lots of email back and forth or other technologies of editing both online.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?

When trying new things and if they work and everyone is ok with it merge into master by making a pull request. Instead making changes to master itself if trying new things out can mess all your previous work.
